### Introduction

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) periodically provides Medicare Shared Savings Program (Shared Savings Program or SSP) Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) with aggregate data reports, including reports displaying aggregated metrics on ACOs’ assigned beneficiary populations (refer to 42 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] § 425.702(b)(1)). CMS also makes available select beneficiary-identifiable information (the minimum data necessary) for ACOs to conduct health care operations work if the ACO elected to receive data as indicated on the application (refer to § 425.702(c)).1 The data included in these program reports, referred to as the Assignment List Report (ALR) and Assignment Summary Report (ASR), take into account differences in assignment methodology in the Shared Savings Program.

This implementation guide defines the models and mechanisms for a FHIR based Assignment List Report (ALR).  See the Overview page for additional information.
